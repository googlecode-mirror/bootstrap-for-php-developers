How the system works

= Introduction =

The system is aiming to do the following, for everything you want to do, it should be 2 steps.
1) tell the system what libraries it needs, 2) use 1 function do to what you want.

= Details =

We should simplify everything to this 2 step arcitecture.

Example

STEP 1

// This loads bootstrap and facebook intergration libraries.
$_setup[bootstrap]=1;
$_setup[facebook]=1;

STEP 2

call the function at the place you want it.
button('Cyan','#','teal',$size,$_dd);

RULES ...
The dropdown data gets created from an array. So we can call data from a database and then send it straight to the results.
